Modified version of dcraw by Dave Coffin that handles Raspberry Pi raw files.

Original from http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/

Modified to handle the JPEG+RAW files that can be generated by the
Raspberry Pi camera modules, or just the raw file with Broadcom
header passing data on raw format and resolution.

Build instructions:
```
sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev libjpeg8-dev gettext liblcms2-dev
./buildme
```
